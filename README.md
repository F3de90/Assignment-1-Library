# Assignment-1-Library

This is a Python project for **Library Management System**, built as part of my assignment.

## Project Description

The program allows users to:
- Add new books to the library
- Search for books by title or author
- Check out and return books
- Display all books
- Handle various types of input errors

Each section of code includes comments explaining the purpose of the logic used and why specific lines or conditions were necessary.

## What I Learned

- I improved my understanding of Python syntax and structure.
- I became more confident handling user input and applying validation checks.
- I learned how to use lists and dictionaries to store and manage book data.
- Practiced error handling techniques using conditions and exceptions.

## Features

- Prevents duplicate Book IDs
- Validates that the year is numeric
- Handles invalid menu inputs
- Provides meaningful user feedback
- Case-insensitive search functionality (It search whether letters are uppercase or lowercase)

## Testing

I created **15 test cases** (AVAILABLE IN THE WORD DOCUMENT of the Assignment) to make sure each feature works as expected and that invalid cases are handled properly. These include:
- Adding valid and duplicate books
- Invalid year or menu input
- Searching with and without results
- Checking in/out available and unavailable books

## Reflection

This project was a valuable experience. It helped me practice writing clean Python code, and I now feel more comfortable with basic data structures and control flow. I also realized the importance of planning features before jumping into code.
